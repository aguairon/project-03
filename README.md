### Website overview
This website allows developers to both keep track of their projects, as of the different packages they need to build them, and find other users or projects.

Other users can be found on the Discover Users tab. This page lists all the users showing their bio, the number of projects they have uploaded so far, the name of their latest one and how many comments they have done. The search bar can be used to find an specific user. This will be done automatically while you type every second.
